# Changelog

All notable changes to `propertee2-java`. Value/type/scope/error semantics are pinned to the
ProperTee language spec (`flatide/ProperTee` LANGUAGE.md) — identical to the frozen
`propertee-java` v1.0.0 up to spec v0.6.0, with the deliberate spec v0.7.0 breaking batch from 0.3.0.

## 0.3.0

Implements the **spec v0.7.0 breaking-change batch** (ProperTee issues
[#1](https://github.com/flatide/ProperTee/issues/1)/[#2](https://github.com/flatide/ProperTee/issues/2)/[#5](https://github.com/flatide/ProperTee/issues/5)/[#6](https://github.com/flatide/ProperTee/issues/6)/[#7](https://github.com/flatide/ProperTee/issues/7)).
**Breaking for scripts** — see the migration note in `docs/LANGUAGE.md` §Changelog. Hosts (TeeBox)
should review scripts before upgrading; no host-API change.

- **Strict conditions** (#1): a non-boolean `if`/`loop` condition raises
  `Condition requires a boolean value. Got <type>` instead of being silently falsy.
- **Short-circuit `and`/`or`** (#2): left to right; the right operand is not evaluated (side effects
  included) when the left side decides. Operand type errors report only the evaluated operand.
- **`RANDOM(max)` removed** (#5): single-argument calls raise `RANDOM() requires zero or two
  arguments`; use `RANDOM(0, max - 1)` for the old meaning.
- **`SLICE(arr, start, count)`** (#6): the third argument is a count (was a 1-based inclusive end in
  practice), unified with `SUBSTRING`/`READ_LINES`. Migrate `SLICE(a, s, e)` → `SLICE(a, s, e - s + 1)`.
- **Strict `LEN`** (#7): non-collections raise `LEN() requires a string, array, or object argument`.
- Conformance: 6 new fixtures (87–92), 3 updated (11/28/64) → **90 fixtures, 241 tests green,
  deterministic**. `docs/LANGUAGE.md` synced to spec v0.7.0 (header now follows spec versioning).

## 0.2.0

Restores the v1 HTTP builtins that were missing from the propertee2 builtin catalog (HTTP calls were
dead in embedded hosts such as TeeBox). Minor bump — the host interface gains a method.

- **`HTTP_GET`, `HTTP_POST`, `HTTP` builtins.** Registered as `Kind.BLOCKING`, so the interpreter runs
  them off the baton via `Coop.blocking` (design §3.1). They return the v1 Result shape
  `{status, ok, value:{status, body, headers}}` — a non-2xx response is `ok=false` with the real
  status/body, a transport failure is `ok=false` with `status=0`. `HTTP_POST` serializes an object
  body to JSON; options accept the `headers`/`header` alias and a `timeout`.
- **Host `PlatformProvider` gains `httpRequest` (+ an `HttpResponse` record).** `DefaultPlatformProvider`
  implements it over `HttpURLConnection` (timeouts, redirects, error-stream read, disconnect in
  `finally`). This is a new method on the host interface — direct implementers must add it.
- **`PlatformAdapter` bridges the v1 `com.flatide.platform.PlatformProvider` HTTP** to the host seam, so
  a v1-API host (e.g. TeeBox's `TeeBoxPlatformProvider`) exposes HTTP with no application-code change.
- Covered by `FacadeHttpBuiltinTest` (real loopback server; GET/POST/404/generic/transport-failure/
  JSON-body/header-alias through the façade path TeeBox uses).

## 0.1.0

First release of the Java 25 virtual-thread cooperative runtime. **Passes the full v1 conformance
suite — all 84 `.tee/.expected` fixtures, byte-for-byte and deterministic.**

### Runtime
- Recursive tree-walk interpreter (no stepper / `AsyncPendingException` replay machine).
- Production **Coop** cooperative runtime: one virtual thread per logical thread, a single baton
  (only one fiber runs at a time → purity, lock-free, determinism), deterministic round-robin
  hand-off, wake timer, and per-fiber context via `ScopedValue`. **Zero preview API dependencies**
  (`StructuredTaskScope` is still preview on JDK 25 and is avoided; `multi` is hand-rolled).
- `Coop.blocking` contract: `SLEEP`, host I/O, and external functions release the baton
  ("release → block → re-acquire") so blocking never freezes the scheduler — and async statement
  replay is gone (leading side effects run exactly once).
- `multi` / `thread` / `monitor`: isolated setup phase, read-only global snapshot (worker purity),
  statement-boundary interleaving, `{status,ok,value}` result collection (auto `#N` + dynamic keys),
  live monitor ticks, and `[THREAD ERROR]` / `[MONITOR ERROR]` reporting.

### Language & builtins
- Full value model — `Integer`/`Double` (division always `Double`), `String`, `Boolean`,
  insertion-ordered objects, 1-based arrays, no null (`{}`), COW deep-copy at boundaries, v1-exact
  display vs JSON formatting, and v1-exact runtime-error messages with positions.
- Builtin catalog: math, type, string + string-matching/regex, array + sort, object, JSON
  (parse/format), timing, `ENV`, file I/O, and `SHELL`/`SHELL_CTX` (core-only without a host
  TaskRunner).

### Host integration
- Built-in properties (`-p` / `_PROPS`), `PlatformProvider` (`DefaultPlatformProvider` for env +
  filesystem), external functions (`registerExternal` / `registerExternalAsync` /  `registerPure`,
  args & return deep-copied), and keyword/function hiding (`setHiddenKeywords` /
  `setIgnoredFunctions`).

### Tooling
- JDK 25 Gradle build (ANTLR visitor codegen, no preview flags); `Engine` embedding API and a
  `propertee2` CLI (`-p` props, `--version`, `--help`).

### Not in 0.1.0 (post-1.0)
- Real `SHELL` / HTTP / Task execution (requires a host TaskRunner).
- `StructuredTaskScope`-based `multi` (swap in once STS leaves preview).
- A `core` / `cli` module split (currently a single artifact).
